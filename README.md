This is a python program that uses loops, conditions, and functions. 
"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a basic hand game usually played between two people, where each 
player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are 
"Rock" (a fist), "Paper" (an open hand), and "Scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers 
extended, forming a V). The winner is determined by the rules: 
• Rock crushes Scissors 
• Scissors cuts Paper 
• Paper covers Rock
